# Section 2: Proposed Impact

Present specification evolved from GJ proposal. Sean will likely cover GJ in his section. 


Your paper on this change proposal should exhibit the following characteristics:

 * Document its proposed impact to the language and its use.

 * Apply the terminology and concepts we have used throughout the course. 
 
 * Provide supporting code examples, diagrams, and other evidence. 
 
 * Cite supporting evidence using primarily primary sources from the community of the language being investigated.


## Proposed Impact
 * Collections classes (Lists, Maps, etc.)
 * Reduce casting
 * Ensure type safety
 * Way to reuse same code with different inputs
 * Implement generic algorithms
 * [Why should I use generics?][1]
