#Conclusion

So, Pizza was originally created by Odersky in order to, among other features, implement generics demonstrated already
in languages such as Haskell.  This was a first attempt that later lead to jsr-14 which simply added this feature in
the Java Programming Language directly.  Although Odersky was not satisfied and continued on to develop the Scala
Programming Language, jsr-14 generics linked Java with previous more functional languages and is widely used in the
community today.  Now, with parameterized types and type variables available in Java the distinction between different
collection types allows for a much better understanding of contravariance, covariance, and invarianc in the Java
language.  The ability to implement your own generic types in an attempt to make a more specialized collection allows
for such an open source community to develop at a healthier rate as well.  These reasons are the broad strokes of the
benefits of the jsr-14 implementation.
