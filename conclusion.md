#Conclusion

So, Pizza was originally created by Odersky in order to, among other features, implement generics demonstrated already
in languages such as Haskell.  This was a first attempt that later lead to jsr-14 which simply added this feature in
the Java Programming Language directly.  Although Odersky was not satisfied and continued on to develop the Scala
Programming Language, jsr-14 generics linked Java with previous more functional languages and is widely used in the
community today.
